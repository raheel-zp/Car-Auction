                Auto Auctions will review the proposed Auction Lot and confirm
                whether it can be listed on the Site. While Auto Auctions may
                assist with creating listings, it is the Seller's responsibility
                to ensure the accuracy of their listings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless you choose the Make an Offer or Buy Now option, the
                Auction Lot must be listed exclusively with us for a Live
                Auction period of 7 to 14 days, with possible extensions. During
                this period, you cannot use another sales platform without our
                written consent.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can set a reserve for the Auction Lot, which can be reduced
                or withdrawn with written notice to Auto Auctions. Increasing
                the reserve requires prior written consent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Auto Auctions does not guarantee the anticipated selling price
                of any Auction Lot. Any estimate provided is an opinion and
                subject to revision at Auto Auctions' discretion.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <strong>Make an Offer:</strong> By consigning your Auction Lot to
            the Make an Offer listing, you allow Buyers to negotiate with you
            for 14 days. If a Buyer's offer is within 30% of the agreed reserve,
            we will notify you. The Buyer pays fees to Auto Auctions if their
            offer is successful.
            <br />
            <br />
            After receiving an offer, you have 24 hours to respond. You can
            accept the offer, let it expire (automatically after 24 hours or
            earlier if a higher offer is made), reject it, or make a
            counter-offer (which expires after 24 hours or earlier if a higher
            offer is made). Making a counter-offer adjusts the agreed reserve or
            Buy Now price accordingly.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Buy Now:</strong> By consigning your Auction Lot to the Buy
            Now listing, you invite Buyers to bid at or above the agreed Buy Now
            price. If a Buyer's bid meets the criteria, the sale is confirmed,
            and you complete the transaction.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are a Seller listing an Auction Lot:
            <ul class="cp_list">
              <li>
                You are responsible for the accuracy of the description,

              </li>
              <li>
                You must ensure the Auction Lot's condition, authenticity, and
                quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                You represent and warrant legal ownership of the Auction Lot and
                guarantee a charge-free and encumbrance-free sale, transferring
                legal ownership to the Buyer.
              </li>
              <li>
                The advertised mileage can exceed the stated amount by no more
                than 1,000 miles at the point of collection by the Buyer.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            If you, as the Seller, withdraw your Auction Lot from sale, fail to
            complete the sale within the agreed timeframe, or violate the terms,
            you will be required to pay fees to Auto Auctions based on the final
            selling price or the last agreed reserve, depending on the
            situation. Minimum charges apply, exclusive of applicable taxes.
            <br />
            <br />
            If a Buyer's bid during a Live Auction or the Buy Now period is
            within 10% of the reserve, Auto Auctions may make a Shortfall
            Payment to the Seller to meet the reserve amount. This payment is
            independent of the sale transaction and does not make Auto Auctions
            a party to the transaction between the Seller and Buyer. The
            Shortfall Payment is made after the Auction Lot is sold, paid for,
            and collected by the bidder, subject to verification by Auto
            Auctions.

            including any information provided in the comments section, is
            accurate and not misleading to the best of their knowledge. The
            Seller has notified or will notify Auto Auctions in writing of any

            regarding the authenticity, provenance, origin, age, condition, or

            While Auto Auctions conducts certain verification processes, such as

            Seller or the Buyer for any errors, misstatements, or omissions in

                (a) Auto Auctions provided the Seller with a copy of the

                and
              </li>
              <li>
                (b) Neither the Seller nor anyone acting on their behalf has

                or omissions in the description within a reasonable time before
                the Live Auction. In such cases, Auto Auctions may consider the
                description as accepted by the Seller.

            To the extent permitted by law, including applicable consumer

            <br />
            <br />
            If a sale is lost due to an inaccurate or misleading description of
            the Auction Lot or the Seller's failure to disclose information that
            could reasonably affect the provenance, title, value, or any other
            aspect of the Auction Lot, the Seller shall be responsible for

            The Seller grants Auto Auctions the full and absolute right to

                  card or debit card will be charged immediately by Auto
                  Auctions for the fees. The fees paid to Auto Auctions are
                  non-refundable, and they do not affect your legal rights as a

                  to pre-authorize any amount applicable to the fees payable to
                  Auto Auctions by the highest bidding Buyer. This payment is
                  automatically due when you win an auction, and you authorize
                  the processing of payment to Auto Auctions at that time. It is
                  your responsibility to ensure sufficient funds are available
                  regardless of any pre authorization. If any payment is

                  Auto Auctions will continue to pursue payment through Stripe
                  until the entire fee is paid. If Stripe is unable to process
                  the fee from your credit or debit card, you must make payment
                  of the outstanding amount within 24 hours of the auction
                  ending. The payment must be made in one of the currencies
